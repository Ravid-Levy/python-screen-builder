## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ pythonistas and GUI enthusiasts.
The Python screen builder is an easy to use tool you can use to create and load a screen for an application.
The GUI it uses is Kivy and the screen builder makes it easy and fun to use.

## Welcome to version 2.0 of the Python GUI Screen Builder project.

### Please read if you are using version 1.0

The version 2.0 of the WidgetScreen class is now subclassed directly from the Kivy Screen class.
There is also a new WidgetContainer class that works like the previous WidgetScreen class.
So, if you have a version 1.0 application, just change the WidgetScreen references to use WidgetContainer.
Please see the example test application below.

## Running the screen builder application

This is what the main screen looks like:

<img src="screenshot.png">

<marquee scrolldelay=20 loop=1>
# it is fun to program in python if you have a nice gui builder
</marquee>

## Requirements

Python of course. Works with latest version of Python.

First of all, you will need to install the Kivy framework in order to run the screen builder.

You can find out how to install Kivy here:
<a href="https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html">Installing Kivy</a>

The latest version of the Kivy framework is what the screen builder currently uses.

## How to use

You can download all of the Python files from the sb folder to a separate location. Then, simply type:

```
python main.py
```
The screen builder main window should appear. You can then start building screens to be used with the GUI.
The sb_test folder contains the test application which you can be used as a template.

When you run the screen builder you can select from an array of GUI widgets on the left sidebar.
For instance, click Button to create a new button widget which will then appear on the screen.
In the properties window on the right you can change the properties of the widget.
Change its text, font, etc. Then File -> Export -> your_screen.json to save.
The json file contains all the information about the button control you selected. Also make sure the name field is filled in.
It should automagically default to button1 for buttons. That is how you reference controls in your Python application.

Here is the sample code for a working application that uses the screen file test_button.json
```
from gui import *
from kivy.app import App
from widget_screen import WidgetScreen

class TestScreen(WidgetScreen):

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(TestScreen, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.load_screen()

class TestApp(App):

    def build(self):
        Window.clearcolor = 'steelblue'
        self.test_screen = TestScreen(file_name = 'test_button.json')
        return self.test_screen

if __name__ == '__main__':
    TestApp().run()

```
If everything is working, when you run the test program:
```
python test_app.py
```
You should see a screen like this:

<img src="screenshot2.png">

And then when you click on the button it should say something in the console window.

That's it, simple and easy to use. ðŸ˜‰

Here is what the code that handles a button might look like:
```
from gui import *
from kivy.app import App
from widget_screen import WidgetScreen

class TestScreen(WidgetScreen):

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(TestScreen, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.load_screen()

class TestApp(App):

    def build(self):
        Window.clearcolor = 'steelblue'
        self.test_screen = TestScreen(file_name = 'test_button.json')
        self.test_screen.button1.bind(on_press = self.on_press)
        return self.test_screen

    def on_press(self, button):
        print("button, button, you pressed the button!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    TestApp().run()

```

# Documentation

## Screen Builder Keyboard and Mouse Commands
Left click a widget to bring it to the foreground.

Right click a widget to see what's behind the current one.

Hold down ``Ctrl`` and keep clicking objects to select multiple and then move them by keeping ``Ctrl`` pressed.

Hold down ``Shift`` and then click to select a widget behind another widget.

Press ``Del`` to delete the currently selected widget.

``Ctrl + A`` to select all screen widgets. Keep ``Ctrl`` down to move all objects around in the screen builder window.

``Ctrl + C`` to copy a selected widget.

``Ctrl + V`` to paste a copied widget into screen builder window.

You must hold down the ``Ctrl`` key when selecting widgets if using the Edit menu.

## Configuration
The settings.json file can be used to add remove widgets from the sidebar pallet as well as configure other settings.

WARNING: You must be careful however when editing the settings.json file. Make a backup copy first.

Hints: to run the screen builder on Linux make sure you set: 

```
windows_dpi_awarensess: null,
```

The gui.py file contains all of the screen builder widgets available some of which may not be configured for the sidebar.

## Widget enhancements to standard Kivy widgets:
When creating a widget programmatically, for instance, you can use x and y to position it relative to the screen upper left corner:

```
b = Button(x = 100, y = 100, text = "Button")
```

## Change Log - what is fixed in version 2.0:

- button image text can now be set back to empty string
- sometimes could not delete widget after changing some properties
- added try-except for bad int values and int to type_name list
- added set_init_pos function to reset initial position of widgets
- made radius (0, 0, 0, 0), not None for all widgets that use this property

## Enhancements in 2.0
- added a WidgetContainer class to replace the WidgetScreen class
- added a WidgetScreen class that subclasses directly from the Kivy Screen class
- added a button_normal_color and button_down_color for Button and Toggle widgets
- added rounded buttons to screen builder
- added start option to piano keyboard
