## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ pythonistas and GUI enthusiasts.
The Python screen builder is an easy-to-use tool you can use to create a GUI for your python application.

The screen builder makes using Python and the Kivy framework fun and easy to use.

## Welcome to version 3.0 of the Python GUI Screen Builder project.

### Please read if you are using version 1.0
```
The latest version of the WidgetScreen class is now subclassed directly from the Kivy Screen class.
There is also a new WidgetContainer class that works like the previous WidgetScreen class.
So, if you have a version 1.0 application, just change the WidgetScreen references to use WidgetContainer.
Please see the example test application below.

## Requirements

Python of course. The screen builder is written using the latest version of Python.

First of all, you will need to install the Kivy framework in order to run the screen builder.

You can find out how to install Kivy here:
<a href="https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html">Installing Kivy</a>

## Running the screen builder application

You can download all of the Python files from the sb folder to a separate location. Then, simply type:

```
python main.py
```
The screen builder main window should appear. You can then start building screens for your applicaiton.

The sb_test folder contains a test application (test_app.py) which you can use as a template.

There are also some other test applications that show how to implement widgets and menus.

You can also compile the screen reader to an executable if you have a python compiler, <a href="https://pyinstaller.org">pyinstaller</a> for instance:

```
pyinstaller -F main.py
cd dist
```
You should see a file called main.exe which can be renamed for instance to something like sb.exe.

Then you can copy it to the python scripts directory (in Windows might be something like: "/Program files/Python/Scripts")

For example if Python is installed in "/Program files/Python", might be:
```
rename main.exe sb.exe
copy main.exe "/Program files/Python/Scripts"
```
Once the sb.exe is accessible via the path variable, you can run it from anywhere.

Note in version 3.0, a version of the settings.json file is included in the program itself.
So, you only need to copy the settings.json file if you are using a custom settings file.

## How to use

When you run the screen builder you can select from an array of GUI widgets on the left sidebar.
For instance, click Button to create a new button widget which will then appear on the screen.
In the properties window on the right you can change the properties of the widget.
Change its text, font, etc. Then File -> Export -> your_screen.json to save.
The json file contains all the information about the button control you selected. Also make sure the name field is filled in.
It should automagically default to button1 for buttons. That is how you reference controls in your Python application.

Here is the sample code for a working application that uses the screen file test_button.json
```
from gui import *
from kivy.app import App
from widget_screen import WidgetScreen

class TestScreen(WidgetScreen):

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(TestScreen, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.load_screen()

class TestApp(App):

    def build(self):
        Window.clearcolor = 'steelblue'
        self.test_screen = TestScreen(file_name = 'test_button.json')
        return self.test_screen

if __name__ == '__main__':
    TestApp().run()

```
Notice the line ```self.load_screen()```. This will load the screen that you have created for your application.

If everything is working, when you run the test program:
```
python test_app.py
```
You should see a screen like this:

<img src="screenshot2.png">

And then when you click on the button it should say something in the console window.

That's it, simple and easy to use. ðŸ˜‰

Here is what the code that handles a button might look like:
```
from gui import *
from kivy.app import App
from widget_screen import WidgetScreen

class TestScreen(WidgetScreen):

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(TestScreen, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.load_screen()

class TestApp(App):

    def build(self):
        Window.clearcolor = 'steelblue'
        self.test_screen = TestScreen(file_name = 'test_button.json')
        self.test_screen.button1.bind(on_press = self.on_press)
        return self.test_screen

    def on_press(self, button):
        print("button, button, you pressed the button!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    TestApp().run()

```

# Documentation

## Screen Builder Keyboard and Mouse Functions
Left click a widget to bring it to the foreground.

Right click a widget to see what's behind the current one.

Note if a widget is covering another widget, you may need to hold down ``Ctrl`` and then left click to bring it to the front.

Hold down ``Ctrl`` and keep clicking objects to select multiple and then move them by keeping ``Ctrl`` pressed.

Hold down ``Shift`` and then click to select a widget behind another widget.

Press ``Del`` to delete the currently selected widget.

``Ctrl + A`` to select all screen widgets. Keep ``Ctrl`` down to move all objects around in the screen builder window.

``Ctrl + C`` to copy a selected widget.

``Ctrl + V`` to paste a copied widget into screen builder window.

``Ctrl + Z`` to undo adding of the current widget.

You must hold down the ``Ctrl`` key when selecting widgets if using the Edit menu.

## Building an application

The screen builder contains two classes you can use to access screens from:

``WidgetScreen`` and ``WidgetContainer``

Both can be used to create the application screen.

Here is a sample application using the WidgetContainer class:

```
from gui import *
from kivy.app import App
from widget_container import WidgetContainer

class TestWidgets(WidgetContainer):

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        screen = kwargs.get('screen')
        super(TestWidgets, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.screen = screen
        self.load_screen()

class TestApp(App):

    def build(self):
        Window.clearcolor = 'steelblue'
        screen = Screen(name = "Test")
        self.test_screen = TestWidgets(file_name = 'test_button.json', screen = screen)
        return screen

if __name__ == '__main__':
    TestApp().run()
```
Notice that that it contains a screen element that needs to point to the Kivy Screen class instance.

Both classes contain a load_screen() function that simply builds the screen from the json screen file_name parameter.

There is also a menu_height parameter you can set to the height of the application menu.

For example: ```test_screen = TestScreen(file_name = 'test_button.json', screen = screen, menu_height = 100)```

## Widget API (gui.py)

The widgets that come with the screen builder are configured to be used programatically and accept all Kivy parameters.
When creating a widget programmatically, for instance, you can use x and y to position it relative to the screen upper left corner:
This enhancement gives the ability to write a more traditionally oriented application similar to existing programming frameworks.

```
b = Button(x = 100, y = 100, text = "Button")
```

The following is a list of some of the widgets available and how to use them to handle events.

To include all of the widgets to be used in the application simply use:
```
from gui import *
```
### Button Class
```
class Button(x = value, y = value, radius = (r1, r2, r3, r4), button_normal_color = (r, g, b, a), button_down_color = (r, g, b, a), . . .)
```
x = horizontal screen position 

y = vertical screen position

button_normal_color = color tuple to set the normal (unpressed) color of the button

button_down_color = color tuple to set the down (pressed) color of the button

radius = tuple for the roundness of the four corners of the button

border_width = thickness of the button border

border_color = color of the border

### ToggleButton Class
```
class ToggleButton(x = value, y = value, radius = (r1, r2, r3, r4), button_normal_color = (r, g, b, a), button_down_color = (r, g, b, a), . . .)
```

Example callback function using ToggleButton:

```
button = ToggleButton(x = 100, y = 100, on_press = toggle)

def toggle(self, instance):
    if instance.state == 'down': pass # do something if button state is down
    if instance.state == 'normal: pass # do something if button state is up
```    

### Label Class
```
class Label(x = value, y = value, text = string)
```

### Panel Class
```
class Panel(x = value, y = value, . . .)
```

### ListBox Class
```
class ListBox(x = value, y = value, . . .)
```

To initialize the list box drop down list:
```
list_box = ListBox(x = 100, y = 100, text = "apple")
list_box.values = [ "apple", "peaches", "pumpkin", "pie" ]
```

To add a callback to the ListBox widget:

```
list_box.bind(value = self.on_select)
.
.
def on_select(self, instance, value):
    print(value) # will print value
```

### Slider Class
```
class Slider(x = value, y = value, . . .)
```
To set the initial slider value:
```
slider.value = 100
```

To add a callback to a slider widget:

```
slider.bind(value = self.on_slider)
.
.
def on_slider(self, instance, value):
    print(value) # will print slider control value
```

### Knob Class
```
class Knob(x = value, y = value, . . .)
```
To set the initial knob value:
```
knob.value = 100
```

To add a callback to a knob widget:

```
knob.bind(value = self.on_knob)
.
.
def on_knob(self, instance, value):
    print(value) # will print knob control value
```

## Configuration
The settings.json file can be used to add or remove widgets from the sidebar pallet as well as configure other settings.

WARNING: You must be careful however when editing the settings.json file. Make a backup copy first.

Hints: to run the screen builder on Linux distros make sure to set: 

```
windows_dpi_awarensess: null
```
This will allow the Linux version to not try to make a Windows graphics initialization call.
