## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ pythonistas and GUI enthusiasts.

## Welcome to the Python GUI Screen Builder project.

The Python screen builder is an easy to use tool you can use to create and load a screen for an application.
The GUI it uses is Kivy, but don't worry - the screen builder makes it easy and fun to use.
This is what the main screen looks like:

```
# it is fun to program in python
```
First of all, when you run the screen builder (the exe version) it works without any Kivy dependencies.
But, when you want to start coding to access the screen and widgets, you need to install Kivy.
It's easy, Kivy is simple to install. You can find out how to install Kivy here:
<a href="https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html">Installing Kivy</a>

Basically it boils down to installing the Kivy framework and its dependencies: angle, glew, sdl2.
For example on Windows which is what the screen builder currently runs on:
```
python -m pip install "kivy[base]" kivy_examples
```
